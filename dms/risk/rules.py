"""Stage 5: fuzzy sets and the four rule blocks of Table 1.6.

Hierarchical design: seven indicators feed three small blocks (Fatigue,
Distraction, Context) whose outputs feed an Overall-Risk block. This needs
27 + 9 + 9 + 36 = 81 rules instead of 3^7 = 2,187 for a flat rule base.

Fatigue F has four levels, which are reported as drowsiness levels:
    Low      -> Alert
    Moderate -> Level 1 (slightly drowsy)
    High     -> Level 2 (moderately drowsy)
    Severe   -> Level 3 (severely drowsy)
Signs that occur together are worse than either alone: drowsiness and yawning
together raise the level by one, and so does a long drive.

Each rule base is generated from a short, stated principle so that it is
complete (every combination has exactly one rule) and easy to audit. Use
``scripts/export_rule_tables.py`` to print the full tables for the thesis.
